# Clipify

This is a small Rust project, that uses ffmpeg to process a short video with multiple tracks into a smaller format with merged audio tracks (for easy sharing). The specific usage is restricted to me at the moment (because of hardcoded track layout and encoder settings), but if the motivation stays, this will be configurable.
